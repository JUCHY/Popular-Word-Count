I keep my ideals with me.
My fate is mine!

Time to pay for all of my mistakes,
That I made without an ounce of shame.
I moved on and threw my life away.
Thank God I got out while I could,
I nearly gave it all away to an unknown and empty fate.
Dead eyes that know the price that I paid.
And if they could only just focus on today,
Maybe they’ll shine!

What’s going on?

A brand new life, but I still feel left behind,
Every day there’s something off, is this what I wanted?

What’s going on?
Is this a game? ‘Cause nobody else is quite the same!
The possibilities have opened up. Ah.

Dreaming! My mind rewinds
I just can’t fill the hole, inside of my heart
So let’s get out, escape from the dark of the night!

The future unknown seems to twist and distort itself unless we look straight forward.
I’m sick of lying to myself got to stand up straight and fight!

I keep my ideals with me, each time
‘Cause dreams and love, so dangerous, the fuel that we need to light the fire

Gongs are ringing out now.
My fate is mine!
